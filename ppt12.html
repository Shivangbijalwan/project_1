                        **Who is Srila Prabhupada?**

Srila Prabhupada, formally known as **His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada**, was a spiritual luminary of the 20th century 🌟, dedicated to spreading the timeless wisdom of Krishna Consciousness worldwide. Born on Nandotsava (the day after Lord Krishna's appearance) in 1896 in Calcutta, India 🇮🇳, Srila Prabhupada was destined for a life of spiritual greatness 🙏.

🌿 **A Divine Childhood and Early Influences** 🌿

From a young age, Srila Prabhupada was immersed in devotion to Lord Krishna 🕉️. His father, a devout follower, nurtured his spiritual inclinations by often hosting sadhus (holy men) at their home 🏡 and encouraging them to bless his son to become a great devotee of Radharani 🌸, the divine consort of Lord Krishna. As a child, Srila Prabhupada organized his own neighborhood Ratha Yatra festivals 🎉, reflecting his early passion for sharing Krishna consciousness.

🎓 **Education and Early Life** 🎓

Srila Prabhupada attended Scottish Church College in Calcutta 🏫, where he excelled academically. His commitment to India’s independence 🌍 led him to join Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement ✊, refusing his diploma as a form of protest. After college, he worked as a manager at Dr. Bose's chemical company 🧪, balancing professional duties with deepening spiritual practices.

In 1922, a pivotal moment occurred when he met his spiritual master, **Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami**, a renowned scholar 📚 and founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes). His guru urged Srila Prabhupada to dedicate his life to spreading Vedic knowledge, particularly in English 🌍.

🌟 **A Lifelong Mission: Spreading Vedic Wisdom** 🌟

In 1933, Srila Prabhupada formally accepted initiation from Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati 🙌 and began his mission by writing a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita 📖. In 1944, he launched "Back to Godhead" magazine 📰, which continues to be published in over thirty languages 🌎.

In 1947, recognizing his devotion, the Gaudiya Vaishnava Society honored him with the title "Bhaktivedanta," signifying one who has realized the end of all knowledge through devotion 🕉️.

🚢 **A Journey to the West** 🚢

At 54, Srila Prabhupada retired from married life and moved to the sacred city of Vrindavana 🌿. There, he began his magnum opus: translating the Srimad-Bhagavatam 📚. In 1959, he accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) and in 1965, at the age of 69, he embarked on a mission to the United States 🌍 with little more than his faith in Krishna and his teachings 💛.

🌍 **Founding ISKCON and Global Impact** 🌍

In 1966, Srila Prabhupada founded the **International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)** in New York City 🏙️, sparking a spiritual revolution. He traveled extensively, establishing 108 temples and spreading Krishna Consciousness 🌟. His translations and commentaries on Vedic texts, including the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad-Bhagavatam, continue to inspire millions today 📚.

🕊️ **A Legacy That Lives On** 🕊️

Srila Prabhupada departed from this world on November 14, 1977 🕯️, but his legacy continues to thrive through ISKCON, which now spans over 100 ashrams, temples, and communities 🌍. His greatest contribution remains his books 📚, which are revered by scholars and devotees alike, and continue to guide souls on the path of devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna 🌸.
